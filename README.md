maintaining the records related to the subject of purchasing books, selecting and ordering 
items for the collection and maintaining the accounts, creating records for material held in 
the collection and providing access to the Librarian. Some important Limitation points are

accessible worldwide.

drawbacks of our system its not accessible anywhere via any web site.

capture and modifications is not possible.

➢ For Fine calculation we are not able to Support Online Payment like (UPI, Credit 
Card, Debit Card Payment) mode.
